/**
 * Contains the execution logic of a Hops job. This class takes care of the main
 * flow control of the application. The job is started by calling the execute()
 * method. Note that this method is blocking. Before this, however, the client
 * must have requested an Execution id by calling the appropriate method on
 * this class. HopsJob then sets up and runs the actual job and finally
 * allows for some cleanup. This class takes care of execution time tracking as
 * well.
 * <p>
 * Three abstract methods are provided for overriding:
 * <ul>
 * <li>setupJob() - This method is called after an Execution id has been
 * procured. </li>
 * <li>runJob() - This method is called after setupJob() finishes. </li>
 * <li>cleanup() - This method is called after runJob() finishes. </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The calls to each of these methods are blocking.
